# kt-appdirs
A currently WIP Kotlin Multiplatform library to simplify Appdirs for Kotlin across all its platforms.

## Java
Simply wraps around [Harawata's AppDirs](https://github.com/harawata/appdirs).
If you are using this in a Kotlin JVM-only project. Stop, and use Harawata's AppDirs instead.
While the performance overhead is minimal, it's unnecessary. This is meant to simplify multiplatform projects
and provide a more XDG compliant Kotlin/Native library.

## Native
Own implementation

## JS
